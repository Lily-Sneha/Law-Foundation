            <h4>Aman Kumar* Versus State of Bihar</h4>

            <p><span>Case Background: </span> On 21.10.2018 a young man aged 22 years was apprehended by the Railway
                Police on
                accusations of theft and was put behind the bars. He was booked under Section 379/411 of the Indian
                Penal Code 1860 i.e., Theft, which prescribes punishment of up to three years or a fine or both. His
                bail application was rejected by the lower court after which he knocked on the doors of Sessions Judge,
                Patna where he was granted bail on 25.05.2019. But due to his inability to furnish bail bond, he was not
                released on bail and languished in jail thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>In January 2022 while a usual visit to Jahanabad Sub-Jail for identifying prisoners in need of legal aid
                we came across this alleged prisoner who was still imprisoned. He has served the total punishment
                prescribed for theft being an under-trial prisoner whose trial was not concluded yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Legal Recourse:</span> Panel Advocates of LAW Foundation filed an evidence close petition in the
                Railway Judicial Magistrate, Patna Jn. for him after knowing his tyrannical journey with the justice
                system. This application was rejected without considering the struggle and conditions faced by him all
                these years. While giving him legal assistance, we did not give up hope. The pathway to justice is
                always difficult, itâ€™s just the hope that keeps up boosted to fight the injustice prevailing in the
                system. In February 2022 a new magistrate was appointed in the Railway Court. Without wasting any time,
                we approached the newly joined magistrate for getting relief. He very well understood our concerns and
                agreed to entertain this petition in light of justice. Thereafter, he closed all evidence in this case
                and acquitted him, on the lack of evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Gaps Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This particular case shows us the several loopholes and gaps
                that our criminal justice system is filled up with. Despite getting bail the person is languishing in
                jail and the judicial officer has no checks and balances in this regard. The chargesheet was filed, the
                cognizance was taken and the charge was also framed in-spite of all this the case is never put on trial.
                A person can only be punished for the prescribed term of punishment. Once he serves the prescribed time,
                he cannot be apprehended but, in this case, the accused is serving in prison more than the prescribed
                tenure while he is an undertrial.
                Justice was never served to him. He is a big example of the negligence bar and the bench towards
                prisoners languishing in jail. He was acquitted after 3 years and 6 months, which is not justice but his
                right to be freed.

        <div class="stories" id="amir">
            <h4>Md. Amir* Versus State of Bihar</h4>

            <p>
                <span>Case Background:</span> Md. Amir, a boy who left his hometown Araria, to hunt for jobs in a big
                city, never
                knew would land up in jail because of the powerful people who misuse their position. Can someoneâ€™s face
                describe his intentions ever, if yes then the jails would have more people there. But, here in this case
                the police merely on the basis of their suspicion that the boy would commit a cognizable offence under
                Sections of I.P.C. arrested him and sent him to judicial custody. While our visit to Samastipur jail for
                the identification of inmates who require legal aid, this boy came up to us and was crying profusely. He
                stated that he used to earn in Jaipur but due to the lockdown he was forced to return back to his
                hometown. Once this COVID situation cooled down he decided to return back to work, and for this, he came
                to Patna to meet a friend while he was searching for him police arrested him under Section 109 of
                Cr.P.C. He was incarcerated under a bailable section that requires the bond and not custody. He was
                there in that prison for near about six months in a single piece of clothing. He also shared his
                motherâ€™s and sisterâ€™s contact numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                His family was contacted and they turned up soon and narrated the agony they had gone through. How they
                were fooled by people in the name of help, and the trust issues they had while we contacted them. The
                family had suffered a lot because of the loopholes the justice system has.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Legal Recourse:</span> Panel Advocates of LAW Foundation tracked the case very well and carried
                out all the
                necessity that was ignored by others. They then filed a bail petition for the beneficiary, called the
                family to be the bailor, spent one whole day making the case a priority, and succeeded in getting bail
                for him on 24.02.22.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Gap Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This case shows the pathetic structure of our justice system,
                and how
                innocent lives are merely ruined based on assumptions. Assumptions canâ€™t be a basis for arresting a
                person because police do not have the capacity to read a personâ€™s mind. When the police take someone in
                their custody the first step, they need to take is to inform the family or close ones of that person
                which was totally neglected. Where the friend or relative of the person arrested lives outside the
                district, the time and place of arrest and venue of custody must be notified by police within 8 to 12
                hours after arrest. This should be done by telegram through the District Legal Aid Authority and the
                concerned police station. When his family reached searching him no information was surpassed to them
                properly all they received were in bits and pieces. No heed was paid towards his fundamental right of
                liberty and was kept imprisoned until and unless we intervened.

        <div class="stories" id="pratibha">
            <h4>Pratibha Devi* and others versus State of Bihar</h4>

            <p>The prison visit to Beur Central Jail exposed us to the injustice present in our judicial system.
                Pratibha Devi a lady who is standing on the doors of her old age is locked behind the bars in her 50s.
                She was booked under Section 498A, 324, 326, 307, 304 (B) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. These offences
                are serious in nature and prescribe a punishment of up to 10 years or life imprisonment.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was alleged that Pratibha along with her elder sister in the month of November 2009 sprinkled
                Kerosene
                on her sister-in-law and put up her on fire. Thereafter in January 2010, she got arrested for this
                offence, while her sister fled away. Pratibha was imprisoned since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021, during the regular prison visit, the case of Pratibha Ji came to our notice. After this Adv.
                Santosh the Senior Counsel of the organization went to Danapur Court and pursued the records and found
                that in all these years nobody from her family hired an advocate to secure bail for her, neither she was
                given any advocate from DLSA. In 2017, in this case, a Non-Bailable Warrant was issued against the
                informant and other witnesses of the case but none turned up. Thrice NBW was issued against the
                informant and witnesses but neither of them appeared to the court on any prescribed date. Then Adv.
                Santosh Kumar along with Adv. Shalini scrutinized the case details and interacted with Pratibha Devi
                through jail officials and procured her signature on Vakalatnama. Then, an application was filed to
                close evidence in this case. The court ordered police officials at Shahpur to file aa service report at
                earliest in this case. As per the report prepared by the police investigating the case, neither the
                informant nor the witnesses ever resided at that place according to the locals thereby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prabha Devi was like a soul waiting for the day to be freed. She had lost her mental capacity for
                understanding. But the judicial system never functions on the emotion of prisoners rather it sticks to
                the judicial policy. Yet, the team comprising Adv. Santosh Kumar, Adv. Shivshankar and Adv. Shalini
                never lost hope of a new beginning in Pratibha Jiâ€™s life.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of International Womenâ€™s Day, the court acquitted Pratibha Devi from all charges in the
                present case on the ground of lack of evidence. She was then released on 9th March 2022. Her brother
                came to receive her and it was an emotional re-bonding of the siblings. Though she lost a major part of
                her life in the twelve years of imprisonment, she did not forget her family her husband, her father, and
                especially her siblings. She has paid a heavy amount in all these years. Her mental health has been
                adversely affected because of this. She does not remember her children. She is not aware that she has
                lost her husband in all these years nor she has the understanding to accept this fact. Justice came to
                her no doubt, but at a heavy cost of 12 years of her life. Maybe she will return to society but will she
                be accepted into society, will her kids accept her, or will she ever get to normalcy with her mental
                condition?

            <h4>Md. Rehan* v. State of Bihar</h4>

            <p>
                The case began at Hanuman Mandir situated at Patna Junction in Patna. Md. Rehan a 19-year-old boy was
                arrested by Kotwali Police in October 2021 for the offence of committing theft of a mobile phone. He was
                sent to judicial custody thereafter. In February 2022, when the team of LAW Foundation visited
                Samastipur Jail, they met him. After returning back to Patna they pursued his case records and found
                that no bail has been filed in the last 4 months on his behalf. A bail application was filed by the
                advocates of LAW Foundation which was heard by the magistrate and allowed, but there was no bailor on
                his behalf. After regular meetings and counseling Adv. Shalini gained his trust and he shared the proper
                address of his family and also his fatherâ€™s mobile number. Without wasting any time, she then contacted
                his father, but his parents hardly cared about his existence. His father said I do not have money; I
                cannot spend my everything on him since I have to take care of my wife and other children too. After
                constant effort, we came to know that his mother died years ago, and his father and his stepmother and
                children disliked him, because of this he left home and started working in a restaurant near Patna
                Junction and landed up behind bars.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Court Procedures:</span> Although the team secured bail but failed to get him out of the jail,
                thus they moved
                ahead with the trial of the case. In the court, they facilitated in the framing of the charge after
                which the witnesses were summoned. But the witness did not turn up after two summonses. The SHO was
                ordered to serve a service report but failed to do so. Thereafter, the court issued a bailable warrant,
                and later in June 2022, an NBW was issued against the witness to appear on the next date.
            </p>

            <p>
                On 29th June all four witnesses were asked to appear again After which they appeared. None of them
                identified the accused and had various discrepancies in their statements. There was no eye witness to
                the case, the case was not investigated by the I.O. properly. Then, on 1st August 2022, the magistrate
                pronounced the judgment in favor of the accused and acquitted him of all the charges.
            </p>

            <p>
                The trial, in this case, was completed in just a span of five months. Although, the accused had to
                remain in jail for nine months yet the best thing is that now he is a free bird and has a chance to
                start with new beginnings. The experience he had with the criminal justice system would make him realize
                the bitter truths of life.

            <h4>Dharamraj Kumar*</h4>
            <h5>(A Minor Child)</h5>
            <p>
                <span>Primary Information:</span> The director of the organization Mr. Praveen Kumar met him in 2016
                during his first
                prison visit. He was wearing a dark blue colored half pant and sky-blue half shirt, which is a school
                uniform usually in Bihar. He was loitering in the ground of the prison when his sight was caught holded
                by Praveen Kumar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dharam Raj Kumar, a boy who was in the sweet fourteen of his life where dreams of having a good life,
                earning a good money, enjoying the adulthood start to peep through the eyes. He belonged to an extremely
                backward class. He had three brothers and 5 sisters, his mother used to sell vegetables at Patna City
                Railway Station and he used to assist her mother every day.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Case Background:</span> Somehow they were trying to cope-up with all their needs, but life
                shattered for them
                on 29.05.2016 when their youngest son Dharam Raj was sent to prison upon allegations of dacoity and
                consumption of drugs. When he was arrested in one case he was made accused in another case of dacoity
                too that occurred in the same area in the month of March where F.I.R was lodged against an unknown
                person. He had no direct relation in both the cases. The overall punishment in all these cases summed up
                to imprisonment of life. Surprisingly, all the accused in this case belonged to one caste i.e., Mahato
                belonging to OBC category.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Legal Recourse:</span> Dharam grabbed attention of Mr. Praveen. In all the people his age was the
                factor that
                struck the eyes. He from nowhere appeared to be an adult who should be kept here in a place made for
                adult prisoners. After having a conversation with the little boy, a home visit was conducted to his
                place where his family and his elder brother told that he was not 20 years as stated by the police
                instead he is just 13 and half years old on the alleged day of occurrence. Mr. Praveen then inquired
                about documents such as birth certificate or school certificate to which the family looked clueless and
                also helpless. Somehow he gathered information of the last class he attended if any in any school, to
                which a positive response was received. Mr. Praveen reached to his school namely Middle School
                Mehandiganj from where he explained the principal everything about the situation and asked him to issue
                a certificate which could verify his age. The school issued the transfer certificate and his age was
                verified in the court of law after which he was declared juvenile in the month of September and his case
                was transferred in Juvenile Justice Board, Gaighat. In the JJ Board, an application was made for
                granting his bail. The Principal of the school was bought before the court and he testified that Dharam
                was a juvenile upon which he was granted bail.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Current Update:</span> The boy who could have been convicted for lifetime is now with his family
                leading a happy life. His case has been dropped and now he is a grown up man
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Gap Analysis and Conclusion:</span> This case not only highlights the issues our criminal justice
                system is filled with but also challenges people holding a very important place in the justice system.
                The case from tip to toe is filled with gaps:
            <ul id="Dharamraj-lists">
                <li>The first appearance of the boy was enough to describe the age of the boy, yet the police ignored
                    his age factor and mentioned his age as 20 years, ending the very purpose of JJ Act.
                </li>
                <li>The police were not capable enough to determine the age of the boy but what happened to the
                    Magistrate, had he too turned blind that he was not able to see that the boy is below 18 and not 20.
                </li>
                <li>The sections imposed upon him were grave and very serious, if the school certificate was not
                    produced he might have had to rot in jail for life.
                </li>
                <li>In the case where an F.I.R was lodged against an unknown person, the informant described the person
                    as one in 18-25 age group, having a strong body, in such case how can the police relate the 14 year
                    old.
                </li>
